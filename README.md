# Zq-Forcing Number Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of algorithms presented in the paper:

**"On the Zq-forcing number: computational approach and exact values"**  
*Aida Abiad and Maryam Moghaddas*  
Submitted to *Journal of Physics: Complexity*

## Files

- `block_graphs.py`  
  Implements the algorithm for computing the zero forcing number (\(Z(G)\)) on **block graphs**.  

- `cactus_graphs.py`  
  Implements the algorithm for computing the q-analoge of forcing number where \(q = 0\) (\(Z_0(G)\)) on **cactus graphs**.  

## Usage

You can either import the code and use the functions `compute_Z` and `compute_Z0`, or run the scripts directly to see our experimental results.
